# Extended Learning
This is the latest change to this repo.  I have created a new local repo on my work machine WSL instance and am now pushing these changes to my Remote Repo.

# Module 3 - Exploring Cisco Purpose-built Products
There are several directories here, each of which contain source
code and JSON reference files for a variety of products:
  * `aci`: Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) demo
  * `meraki`: Cisco Meraki demo
  * `sdwan`: Cisco Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) demo
  * `security`: Cisco Security Product reference code (not shown in course)
  * `webexteams`: Cisco Webex Teams demo

>Note: Version 2 will be way better
